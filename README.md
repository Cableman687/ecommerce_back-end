![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Description

- The motivation to complete this challenge was to test my own skills gained in the most recent week of the coding bootcamp, including but not limited to: ORM, Async Await, RESTful Routes, Validation, One-to-One and One-to-Many.
- This project was built as a testing ground for my own retention of the aforementioned skills.
- This app allows a bussiness or employer run an effective back-end web server to manage their inventories through user requests.
- What did you learn?

1) Navigate to the database (db) folder in the root directory, sign into your mysql using 'mysql -u root -p' and entering your password, and run command 'SOURCE schema.sql'
2) Exit from mysql by typing 'exit' and hitting the 'enter' key. Once complete and you are back in gitBash, run command 'npm run seed' to seed the databases you have just created.
3) Navigate to the root folder (if not there already), and run command 'npm start' to begin the app.
